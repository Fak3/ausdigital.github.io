<a id="purpose-of-this-site" class="anchor" href="#purpose-of-this-site" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose of this site</h1>

<p>Exchange of buisness documents like invoices between business finance systems ought to be as simple as email.  This site provides some open specifications and test services designed to make that easy.</p>

<ul>
<li>As a business, I want to send electronic invoices to my customer systems and know the payment status so I can manage my cashflow and get cheap debtor financing if I need it.</li>
<li>As a business I want all invoices and tax receipts from my authorised suppliers to be automatically loaded to my financial system ready for my approval so I can reduce my administration burden.</li>
</ul>

<p>We want the simplest, lowest cost and most secure solution to these needs so we've developed a suite of RESTful API standards and thrown in strong identity measures that support end-to-end encryption and digital signatures.  This site supports implementers by providing:</p>

<ul>
<li>A suite of <a href="#the-technical-framework-specifications">technical specifications</a> and free test points.</li>
<li>A suite of <a href="#the-business-document-semantic-specifications">semantic specifications</a> and free test points.</li>
<li>A set of <a href="#the-special-interest-groups">special interest groups</a> with collaboration tools.</li>
<li>A transparent <a href="#specification-governance-model">governance model</a> with free participation for any interested party.</li>
</ul>

<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au/">Australian Digital Business Council</a> has published an interoperability framework that aims to increase national productivity through automation of common buisness processes such as invoicing. The standards are based on a "4 corner model" from Europe that depends heavily on traditional EDI hubs and includes the following specifications published to the <a href="http://digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au/einvoicing-interoperability-framework">Interoperability Framework</a> page;</p>

<ul>
<li>A service discovery model based on based on OASIS <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/bdxr/BDX-Location/v1.0/cs01/BDX-Location-v1.0-cs01.html">BDX-L</a> (DNS Lookup) and <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/bdxr/bdx-smp/v1.0/cs01/bdx-smp-v1.0-cs01.html">BDX-SMP</a> (detailed metadata) standards. The ADBC has published profiles of the OASIS specifications as the <a href="http://digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au/einvoicing-interoperability-framework/documents/42401/download">DCL</a> and the <a href="http://digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au/einvoicing-interoperability-framework/documents/42402/download">DCP</a> specifications.</li>
<li>A messaging model based on OASIS <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ebxml-msg/ebms/v3.0/core/os/ebms_core-3.0-spec-os.html">ebMS3</a> and <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ebxml-msg/ebms/v3.0/profiles/AS4-profile/v1.0/os/AS4-profile-v1.0-os.html">AS4</a> standards. The ADBC profile is published as the <a href="http://digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au/einvoicing-interoperability-framework/documents/42403/download">"Access Point"</a> specifciation.</li>
<li>A semantic model based on OASIS <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1.html">UBL 2.1</a> standards.  The ADBC profile is published as the <a href="http://digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au/einvoicing-interoperability-framework/documents/42399/download">"eInvoicing Semantic Model"</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The ADBC specifications have a weak technical security model (no encryption, no signatures, and an identity model based on known customers of the EDI hubs).  As a consequence, the ADBC model demands high integrity behaviour from the Hubs.  This is implemented as a suite of accreditation and governance models operated and enforced by the ADBC:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au/accreditation/documents/42924/download">Access Point Provider Agreement</a> and</li>
<li>The <a href="http://digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au/accreditation/documents/42923/download">Digital Capability Publisher Provider Agreement</a> and</li>
<li>Some internal governance rules that are not generally published. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Digital Business Council has also created a RESTful working group that aims to provide a simpler and more secure implementation model based on ubiquitous internet standards such as REST.  The RESTful model is also "secure by design" because it strongly separates the role of the identity provider from any service providers and includes end-to-end encryption and signatures.  COnsequently the RESTful model has no need for the complex governance arrangements.  This site is the repository for those specifications.  </p>

<h1>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it Works</h1>

<p>Unlike single provider APIs (eg google or facebook), a B2B community needs all businesses to implement the same interface so that the same document format (e.g. an invoice) can be sent from any business to any other business.  To do so securely also needs a key distribution model so that senders can find recipient public keys to encrypt messages and so that recipients can find sender public keys to verify signatures.  The Ausdigital.org RESTful framework therefore has some similarities and some key differences compared to the ADBC 4-corner model:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is a Peer-to-Peer model so essentially a "2 corner model" that does not need traditional EDI hubs. </li>
<li>It includes a "Transaction Access Point" (TAP) that is a high avaialbility end point proxy for encrypted messages and cannot inspect the payload.</li>
<li>It includes a new "Identity Provider" (IDP) framework that recognises the existence of an independent identity market that can be leveraged by the framework to provide identity confidence at different assurance levels.</li>
<li>It includes a service discovery framework that is backwards compatible with the ADBC DCL and DCP specifications but extends them to support distributed key management.</li>
<li>It includes a new "Notary" (NRY) specification that provides a blockchain based proof of existence of digital transactions that can be used for non-repudiable audit and new financial services (such as invoice financing for small &amp; medium businesses).</li>
<li>It includes exactly the same invoice semantic model as the ADBC invlice specifications but uses a JSON representation and, more importantly, includes an invoice signed status response document from the buyer (eg "got your invoice and it's approved for payment in 60 days") that can be used for invoice financing purposes. </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="AusDigitalHomepage.png" alt="Framework Diagram"></p>

<p>The success of the interoperability framework depends on uptake by the ledger software providers. Those systems must implement a number of interfaces in a consistent way - which requires clear standards, good test services, and easy to use tooling.  That is the purpose of this site.</p>

<h1>
<a id="the-technical-framework-specifications" class="anchor" href="#the-technical-framework-specifications" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Technical Framework Specifications</h1>

<p>There are five technical specifications, each with it's own github repository.  Ledger vendors must implement in accordance with the <a href="#compliance-statement-for-technical-specifications">compliance statement</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="the-identity-provider-specification" class="anchor" href="#the-identity-provider-specification" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Identity Provider specification</h2>

<p>A federated set of one or more identity providers are the key source of trust for the network.  This specification defines a standard taxonomy of OIDC claims and scopes, together with a set of identity assurance levels and a standard way to link identity claims.</p>

<p>The technical framework exists only to provide the foundation for the secure and reliable interchange of business documents such as electronic invoices.  The specifications in this section describe the semantics of each business document.  Note that;</p>

<ul>
<li>the semantics can vary depending on the process context - for example "commercial invoice" and "reciptient created tax invoice" are two different processes that leverage the same document type.<br>
</li>
<li>each process has at least two roles (eg Buyer and Seller) with different requirements under the specification.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore the semantic specifictions group compliance requirements by process and role.</p>

<p>Like the technical specifications, the semantic specification are developed using the <a href="http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/">COSS</a> (Consensus Oriented Specification System) governance model.</p>

<h2>
<a id="billing-semantics-specification" class="anchor" href="#billing-semantics-specification" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Billing Semantics specification</h2>

<p>The Billing Specifications are based on <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1.html">OASIS UBL2.1</a> <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.1/UBL-2.1.html#S-BILLING">billing semantics</a> and include the Invoice, Credit Note, Debit Note, and Application Response documents.  The process roles are buyer and seller.  The invoice specification is semantically identical to the to <a href="http://digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au/accreditation/documents/42381/download">ADBC e-invoice semantic model</a>.</p>

<h1>
<a id="governance-model" class="anchor" href="#governance-model" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Governance Model</h1>

<h2>
<a id="specifciation-governance" class="anchor" href="#specifciation-governance" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Specifciation Governance</h2>

<p>All technical specifications are developed in the public domain using the <a href="http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/">COSS</a> (Consensus Oriented Specification System) governance model.  COSS ensures that any interested party can participate (because it imposes no restrictions on contributions). It also maximises consensus because, if the editor does not accept your contribution, you can always fork the specification and become the new editor (if others agree they'll follow, but if nobody else likes your fork then you'll be editor of a lonely specification that will wither on the vine).</p>

<h2>
<a id="implementation-governance" class="anchor" href="#implementation-governance" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Implementation Governance</h2>

<p>The secure-by-design nature of the framework eliminates the need for implementation governance or any provider accreditations. Furthermore, the use of independent identity providers such as banks, government, or other entities subject to <a href="http://www.austrac.gov.au/businesses/obligations-and-compliance/customer-due-diligence">"know your customer" legisation</a> means that identity assurance is, by definition, not governed by the ADBC.  Therefore, implementation governance within this framework is reduced to;</p>

<ul>
<li>Defining a set of assurance levels that are used to classify identity providers - so that particpants in the network can have a clear shared understanding of the identity integrity of any message sent or received.  This is the role of the [IDP Specification]((<a href="https://identity-provider.readthedocs.org/">https://identity-provider.readthedocs.org/</a>).</li>
<li>A key principle that relying parties (eg implementers of the SMP or TAP specifications) will stake their reputation on the strength of identity that they demand for their customers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="how-to-participate" class="anchor" href="#how-to-participate" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to participate</h2>

<p>All specifications are developed in the public domain.  To make your voice heard, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>To comment on a specification, click on the relevant "Issues List" link against any <a href="#the-technical-framework-specifications">technical specification</a> and then hit "new issue" when you land in github.</li>
<li>To participate in a special interest group, click on the relevant "chat room" link in the <a href="#the-special-interest-groups">special interest group</a> table.</li>
<li>If you just want to be kept informed, then click on relevant "Mailing list" link in the <a href="#the-special-interest-groups">special interest group</a> table.</li>
</ul>

<p>A new technical specification can be launched at any time via the following process:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital.github.io/issues">Raise a ticket</a> in the root ausdigital repository with title “Proposed SPEC”.  Document a high level scope and purpose of the proposed spec in the issue.</li>
<li>Prove evidence of participation interest by collecting "+1" in the form of comments on the issue from at least 6 other people from at least 3 different organisations. </li>
<li>Nominate an Editor</li>
<li>Indicate acceptance of the <a href="http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/">COSS</a> governance model and the <a href="http://semver.org/">SemVer</a> versioning model for specification development.</li>
<li>Once steps 1 to 4 are complete, we will create the repository, give the editor write access, and add the default document template</li>
<li>The new editor should then notify relevant special interest groups of issues or questions regarding the new SPEC</li>
</ol>
