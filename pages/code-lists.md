# Code Lists specification

This specification defines a framework for the expression of context specific UBL code lists in JSON syntax as web resources. It also provides actual JSON web resources for the library of default UBL code lists such as currency codes, payment means, and so on.

| Specification URL | Version | Status | API Definition | Issues List |
| ----------------- | ------  | ------ | -------------- |  -------- |
| [Codes Lists 1.0 spec](http://ausdigital-code.readthedocs.io/) | 1.0 | ![Raw](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/raw.svg) |Not applicable |  [Code Lists 1.0 Issues](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-code/issues)  |

Note that the codes specification does not require an API because codes are managed directly in Github and are consumed by the document validation APIs.  Similarly there is no implementations list because code management is in Github and implementations will include code lists within their implementation of each business process (eg billing).
