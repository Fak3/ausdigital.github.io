# The e-Invoicing Business Case

Businesses in the Australian economy exchange approximately 1 Billion invoices per year to a total value of around $4 Trillion and, on average, payment is made 55 days after the invoice is issued.    

* Each invoice costs an average of $25 to process due to manual handling (re-keying) and errors (mis-keying). If all invoices were exchanged automatically between buyer and seller financial systems then there is a potential to improve mational productivity by up to $25 Billion per year.
* Around $500 Billion ($4Tn x 55/365 days) is held in accounts payable processes at any time and about 20% to 30% of that is debt to small business suppliers that have no alternative than to fund cashflow from homeloans and credit cards.  If every invoice and invoice response were digitally signed and written to the block-chain then small business would have access to a new trade financing instrument that could inject up to $100Bn of additional growth funding cashflow into the national economy.

But the uptake of e-invoicing in Australia is approximately 10% to 15% and almost none of them are suitable for trade financing.  By world standards, Australia is a laggard.   Ausdigital.org standards represent the most modern and lowest cost model for e-invoicing that, if adopted widely, would allow Australia to leapfrog the rest of the world.
