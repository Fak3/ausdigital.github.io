# The e-Invoicing Business Case

## Executive Summary

Businesses in the Australian economy exchange approximately 1 Billion invoices per year to a total value of around $4 Trillion and, on average, payment is made 55 days after the invoice is issued.    

* Each invoice costs an average of $20 AUD to process due to manual handling (re-keying) and errors (mis-keying). If all invoices were exchanged automatically between buyer and seller financial systems then there is a potential to avoid mistakes and re-keying and consequently improve mational productivity by up to $20 billion per year.
* Around $600 billion ($4Tn x 55/365 days) is held in accounts payable processes at any time and about 20% of that is debt to cashflow contrained small business suppliers that have no alternative than to fund cashflow from homeloans and credit cards.  If every invoice and invoice response were digitally signed and written to the block-chain then small business would have access to a new trade financing instrument that could inject an additional $100 Billion of growth-funding cashflow into the national economy.

But the uptake of e-invoicing in Australia is approximately 10% to 15% and almost none of them are suitable for trade financing.  By world standards, Australia is a laggard.   [Ausdigital standards](http://ausdigital.org/) represent the most modern and lowest cost model for e-invoicing that, if adopted widely, would allow Australia to leapfrog the rest of the world.

Numbers like $20Bn of annual productivity gains and $100Bn of additional cashflow funding are too big to throw around without some evidence to support them.  The list of references at the bottom of this page and the assessment of each should provide confidence that the numbers are, if anything, conservative.

1.  This [e-invoicing white paper](https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/e-invoicing-white-paper.pdf) from the [US Federal Reserve Banks](https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/) provides a nice summary of many other studies and reports.  It confirms a general rule of thumb that a developed economy will have a total annual B2B invoice volume (in billions of invoices) between one and two times it's GDP in trillions.  The USA issues about 25 billion invoices and has a GDP of $18 trillion.  Australia has a GDP of $1.4 trillion and should therefore issue between 1 and 2 billion B2B invoices per year.
2. This [2016 payments annual review](http://www.apca.com.au/docs/default-source/annual-reviews/apca-annual-review-2016.pdf) from [APCA] shows both volume and value for Australia's main payment methods. Ignoring the high value clearing system (which would be mostly financial securities trading) and EFTPOS/Cards (which would be mostly B2C purchases), then the remaining direct credits volume can reasonably be taken to represent the majority of B2B payments.  There are 2.3 billion direct credit payment transactions to a value of $8 trillion in Australia - which would seem to confirm that 1 billion B2B invoices with a total value of $4 trillion is a conservative estimate for the Australian economy - and roughly the same as top down GDP based estimate.
3. This [late payments discussion paper](https://industry.gov.au/smallbusiness/Documents/PromptPaymentProtocolDiscussionPaper22July2013.pdf) from the Australian [Federal Dept of Industry](https://industry.gov.au) confirms the average payment times for Austrlain invoices at around 55 days - one of the worst in the world.  The 55 day figure is also verified by this [State of Late Payments Reposrt](http://info.marketinvoice.com/hubfs/The_State_of_Late_Payment_MarketInvoice_2016.pdf) from [MarketInvoice](https://www.marketinvoice.com), a UK trade financing business.  It shows Australia at the bottom of the late payers leage table at 26 days later than the standard 30 days terms (so totalling 56 days).  If the total annual value of B2B invoices is conservtively $4 trillion then this late payment fiugure means that around $600 billion of cashflow is locked up Buyer's accounts payable at any one time in Australia.
4. This [e-Invoicing in Australia Report](http://www.sbr.gov.au/about-sbr/reports/digital-transformation-sbr-strategic-reports/implementing-e-invoicing-on-a-broad-scale) commissioned by the ATO and provided by [Billentis](http://www.billentis.com/), a European e-invoicing advisory confirms the rough volume of about 1 billion B2B invoices per year in Australia.  It also estimates a procesing cost of around $30 per paper invoice - which includes both seller and buyer costs for a single invoice document.  It also estimates about 10% to 15% uptake of e-invocing in Australia which is below the european average, far below the latin american average and roughly equal to the US average.

This [GDP and Gross Output Statistics](https://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=51&step=1#reqid=51&step=51&isuri=1&5114=a&5102=15) table from the US [Dept of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov) defines a measure of national productivity called [gross output](https://www.bea.gov/faq/index.cfm?faq_id=1034) which is a better indicator of total B2B sales in an eoonomy because, unlike GDP calculations, it does not look only at the final output of the supply chain but also includes the transactions along the supply chain.  Gross output is roughly double GDP.  This measure provides an additional verification for Australian total B2B sales (ie invoice) value at double $1.4 trillion USD - about $4 trillion AUD.  
6. This Reserve bank of Australia [Small Business Conditions and Finance](http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/confs/2015/) report includes a number of separate research papers that provide considerable depth of analysis on the question of how Australian small businesses fund their growth.  One paper shows quite clearly that the propensity for financial institutions to provide trade financing (ie loans against invoices) virtually evaporated after the financial crisis and has not substantially returned (especially in Australia).  Not surprisingly, there is a corresponding finding that 80% of small busineses with debt include home family home equity and personal credit card collateral - because these loans are considered less risky.  The extent to which lack of access to business finance is choking SME growth and employment is also found to be more significant in the Ausrtalian economy than some others that have more mature trade finance markets.
7. These are a multitude of reports that provide some estimates of the average processing cost of a paper invoice.  Estimates vary from around $5 UD to as much as $50 USD.  Not surprisingly, estimates from reports that are funded by e-invoicjng service providers attach a higher cost to paper processing.  This [assessment of accounts payable cost](http://ww2.cfo.com/expense-management/2015/06/metric-month-accounts-payable-process-cost/) from CFO magazine is drawn from a survey of US firms and simply divides total AP costs by invoice volume for a numebr of firms.  It is likely to be less biased by solution marketing imperitives and it finds a median AP costs of $8 USD (about $12 AUD) per invoice.  This represents only the buyer side (AP) costs.  Seller side (AR) costs must also be factored but are usually less than AP costs because invoices are issued by AR systems and re-keyed by AP system administrators.  Nevertheless, an average benchmark of around AUD $20 per invoice for total AR and AP processing is likley to be a conservative estimate.
